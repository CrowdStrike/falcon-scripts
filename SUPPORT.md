# Falcon Scripts Support

Falcon Scripts is a community-driven, open source project designed to streamline the deployment and use of the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor. While not a formal CrowdStrike product, Falcon Scripts is maintained by CrowdStrike and supported in partnership with the open source developer community.

## Issue Reporting and Questions

Issues may be reported [here](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-scripts/issues/new) and are used to track bugs, documentation and link updates, enhancement requests and security concerns.

## Support Escalation

Generally, we endeavor to provide support for using Falcon Scripts here within the repository. This expands our online knowledge base, enables self-help for our community, and can reduce the amount of time for you to receive answers.

If you are a CrowdStrike customer and you would prefer to have your questions or issues handled directly with CrowdStrike Support, you are welcome to [contact the CrowdStrike technical support team](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/).
